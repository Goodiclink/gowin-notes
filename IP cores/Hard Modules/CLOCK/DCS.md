Dynamic Clock Selector
======================

Each **DCS** can select between four clock sources. There are two modes of clock
switching, a glitchless mode of operation, and a non-glitchless mode of
operation.

Ports
-----

- **CLK0**: Clock input 0.
- **CLK1**: Clock input 1.
- **CLK2**: Clock input 2.
- **CLK3**: Clock input 3.
- **CLKSEL**: Clock selection input. This is a 4-bit input port, each bit
  corresponds to one of the four clock inputs.
- **SELFORCE**: Mandatory clock selection mode input.
    - 0: Glitchless mode.
    - 1: Non-glitchless mode.
- **CLKOUT**: Clock output.

Parameters
----------

- **DCS_MODE**: Clock selection mode, default is "RISING".

Modes
-----

*x* mentioned below is the clock input number (0~3).

| Mode         | Description                                                       |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "RISING"     | Rising edge (of the selected clock) triggered.                    |
| "FALLING"    | Falling edge (of the selected clock) triggered.                   |
| "GND"        | Clock is gated off.                                               |
| "VCC"        | Clock is gated on.                                                |
| "CLK*x*"     | Clock input *x* is selected.                                      |
| "CLK*x*_VCC" | Clock output as clock input *x* if selected, otherwise gated on.  |
| "CLK*x*_GND" | Clock output as clock input *x* if selected, otherwise gated off. |
| SELFORCE = 1 | Non-glitchless mode. Output as selected. **DCS_MODE is ignored**. |

IP Customization Dialog
-----------------------

If DCS module is generated by IP Core Generator, SELFORCE and DCS_MODE are
configured to be constants. Edit the generated module definition file if you
want to change them.

Limitations
-----------

For LittleBee®(小蜜蜂®) (1K, 2K, 4K) family FPGAs, there are 2 global clocks with
DCS (GCLK6~GCLK7) per each of the two quadrants, hence the total number of DCS
is 4.

For LittleBee®(小蜜蜂®) (9K) and Arora(晨熙®) family FPGAs, there are 2 global
clocks with DCS (GCLK6~GCLK7) per each of the four quadrants, hence the total
number of DCS is 8.

Some other IP cores may consume DCSes. Please refer to the IP core's
documentation, and check the *Place & Route Report*.
